## Getting Started

This project uses Flutter Version Manager (fvm) see: https://fvm.app/

If you are using fvm as well run these commands first:

1. fvm install 
2. fvm flutter pub get
3. fvm flutter run

Under the .fvm folder u can find the fvm_config.json. The current used Flutter version for this project is 3.19.4.

Please make sure that u use this version or higher to prevent unexpected errors if you don't use Flutter Version Manager.
